            I've been teaching guitar since I was 18 and love it, but working
            with code and seeing it blow people's minds is amazing for me. I
            love it.

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
              Hello World! My name is Matt Germeyer, and I'm a developer. I've
              been writing and teaching code for the last few years and love it.
              My other passions are guitar, cooking, games and soccer. I've been
              fascinated by how people learn and finding better ways to teach
              for years now. I find that some of the most talented folks often
              struggle to communicate their thought process clearly to students
              while maintaining their sharp focus. My background in teaching at
              several levels, and previous work in high stress environments has
              helped me develop strong communication skills that really matter
              when setting someone off on a new learning path. Teaching people
              matters a lot to me and I take it very seriously. That said, most
              people find me rather chill to be around, just sayin :)
